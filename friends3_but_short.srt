Excuse me, miss.

- It's Phoebe.

- Hi.

Okay, will that be all?

Wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,318
Yeah, um, I was over there...

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,196
...then you said, "Excuse me, miss."
So now I'm here.

10

No, no. How come you're working here?

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:38,537
Right. Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are really cute.

Can we start over?

I don't know whether he's testing me
or just acting out...

...but my monkey is out of control.

16
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,019
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,522
Supposedly by accident.

18
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,857
Oh, yeah, I've done that.

19
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:55,739
And three days in a row, he got
to the newspaper before I did...

20
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,200
...and peed all over the crossword.

I've never done that.

exactly like her sister.

JOEY: No.

Look, this could be a really long game.

Your sister, Ursula.

- Yeah.

She works at that place, uh...

Riff's. Yeah, I know.

Oh, you do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

Hmm? Yeah.

So, um, is she fat?

Not from where I was standing.

Uh, Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

It's mostly just dumb
sister stuff, you know?

46
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,770
Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

47
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,357
Oh. Oh. She was the first to walk...

48
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,485
...even though I did it
later that same day.

"Yeah, what else is new?"
