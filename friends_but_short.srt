1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,301
You don't understand.

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,529
For us, kissing is as
important as any part.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,207
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,071
You serious?

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,068
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,750
- Everything is in that first kiss.
- Absolutely.

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,511
For us, kissing's an opening act..

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,848
like the comedian
you have to sit through..

9
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,082
before Pink Floyd comes out.

10
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,593
And it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

11
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:37,963
It's just that that's not
why we bought the ticket.

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,005
The problem is, no matter
how great the show was..

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,736
you girls are looking
for the comedian again.

14
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:52,883
We're in the car, fighting traffic,
just trying to stay awake.

15
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,789
Word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

16
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:02,723
Or next time you'll find yourself
listening to that album alone.

17
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,868
Are we still talking about sex?

18
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,297
The One With the Sonogram at the End

19
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,355
No, it's good. It is good.

20
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,185
It's just that Doesn't she seem
a little angry?

21
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,724
Well, she has issues.

22
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,655
Does she?

23
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,390
Try to live with "Mr. I'm Evolving."
